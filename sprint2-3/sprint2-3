Decisions
Frontend & Backend Frameworks

Frontend:
HTML/CSS for the product browsing and login interfaces.
JavaScript for dynamic interactions (sorting and pagination).
Backend:
Spring Boot with MySQL for robust backend integration.
Database:

MySQL database will store:
Product data:
id, name, imageUrl, tag, price, category.
User data:
user_id, user_name, user_password, email.
Sorting and Pagination:

Sorting Parameters:
Products will be sorted by price (ascending/descending), name (alphabetical), or popularity.
Pagination:
The backend will limit products per page and dynamically serve data for navigation.

Sprint Deliverables
Product Browsing Page:
Displays all available products dynamically fetched from the database.
Product cards include details such as name, price, image, and category.
Sorting Functionality:
Sorting options (price, name, popularity) available as a dropdown menu.
Backend processes sorting parameters and dynamically adjusts the product list.
Pagination Functionality:
Displays a maximum of 10 products per page.
Includes "Next" and "Previous" buttons, as well as page number navigation.
Login System:
Finalize user login functionality with backend integration.
Error handling for invalid credentials.



Sprint 4 goals(maybe):
because we have finished almost all of opreations for the website so we planing not to do it , becasue this backend thing is so torture
and we need to learn and look for resources for a lot of stuff although its fun but i think we are gonna end it here originally we are going
to do the cart function and payment but now we decide maybe not to do it
